### Machine learning algorithms by example

This repository contains Python implementations of classic algorithms in machine learning. The examples loosely follow the sequence of Aurélien Géron's Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, but with some additional examples not covered there. # machine-learning
